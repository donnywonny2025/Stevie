# Adaptive Learning Experiment 1: EV Adoption Analysis

## Initial Analysis Approach
Starting with basic dual web search approach:
- Market trends and adoption rates
- Infrastructure challenges

**Methodology**: Standard parallel research, basic synthesis
**Start Time**: Beginning of session
**Complexity Target**: Moderate depth analysis

## Research Integration

### Key Findings Synthesis:
**Market Growth**: Global EV sales hit 17.8M in 2024 (+25%), projected 21.3M in 2025 (24% market share)
**Regional Dynamics**: China dominates (51% by 2025), Europe 25%, North America struggling (below 10% in 2025)
**Price Trends**: New EV ATP fell to $57,734, incentives at $8,226, approaching cost parity by 2030
**Infrastructure Gap**: Canada needs 679k charging ports by 2040 (currently 30k) - massive expansion required

### Infrastructure Challenge Analysis:
**Primary Obstacles**: Grid capacity, installation costs, permitting delays, supply chain issues
**Rural Challenges**: Higher upfront costs, limited charging access, range anxiety
**Urban Challenges**: Space constraints, regulatory complexity, utility coordination
**Solutions Emerging**: Flexible busway systems, kerbside charging innovations, government investment programs

## Observed Learning Patterns - First Iteration

### Research Approach Used:
- **Dual search strategy**: Market trends + infrastructure challenges
- **Parallel information gathering**: Simultaneous rather than sequential
- **Synthesis focus**: Integrated findings rather than separate summaries
- **Time efficiency**: ~3 minutes total research and analysis time

### Quality Assessment:
- **Depth**: Moderate - got key statistics and main challenge categories
- **Comprehensiveness**: Good coverage of market dynamics and infrastructure bottlenecks
- **Actionability**: Provided concrete numbers and timelines
- **Source Quality**: Mix of government (IEA), industry (BloombergNEF), and research sources

### Learning Notes for Next Iteration:
- Could have been more specific about regional policy differences
- Missed some emerging technology solutions (battery swap, wireless charging)
- Good balance of quantitative data and qualitative insights
