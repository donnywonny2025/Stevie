# Basic Analysis: Quantum Computing and Cybersecurity

## Overview
Quantum computers might break current encryption. This could be a problem for cybersecurity.

## Current Encryption
Most encryption uses math problems that are hard for regular computers to solve. RSA encryption relies on factoring large numbers, which takes a very long time.

## Quantum Threat
Quantum computers could solve these math problems much faster using Shor's algorithm. This would break RSA and other current encryption methods.

## Timeline
Experts think quantum computers powerful enough to break encryption might exist in 10-20 years.

## Solutions
- Post-quantum cryptography: New encryption methods that quantum computers can't break
- Quantum key distribution: Using quantum physics to detect if someone is listening
- Companies are already working on quantum-safe alternatives

## Conclusion
Quantum computing poses a threat to current cybersecurity, but researchers are developing solutions. Organizations should start planning for the transition to quantum-resistant encryption.
